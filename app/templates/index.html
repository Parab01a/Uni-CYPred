<!--<hr>-->
<!--<p>Drug metabolism via the cytochrome P450 system has emerged as an-->
<!--    important determinant in the occurrence of several drug interactions that can result in drug toxicities, reduced-->
<!--    pharmacological effect, and adverse drug reactions. Recognizing whether the drugs involved act as enzyme substrates,-->
<!--    inducers, or inhibitors can prevent clinically significant interactions from occurring. The SuperCYPsPred web server is-->
<!--    focused on five major CYPs isoforms, including 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, that are responsible for more than 90% of the metabolism-->
<!--    of clinical drugs. Besides the predictions, the web server provides literature curated details on known cytochrome interaction network of-->
<!--    approved drugs.</p>-->
